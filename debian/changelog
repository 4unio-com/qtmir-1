  * Reduce suspend timeout to half of the previous value because the
    long value was too apparent on fast paced apps, like web games of
    music players; it broke the user experience according to design.

  * MirSurfaceItem: always try to consume new mir frames Otherwise those
    frames will get dropped and MirSurfaceItem will therefore never use
    them, being left displaying an old, stale, frame until the
    application renders again.This could happen for instance if an
    application was rendering between the time the Application object
    goes to Suspended state and the actual process getting SIG_STOPPED
    (ie, suspended for real). Frames rendered in this interval were
    getting dropped and once that app was resumed and its MirSurfaceItem
    brought to front the user would see an old stale frame until some
    new event caused the application to render a new frame (e.g. an
    input event) (LP: #1353374)

  * Rename client plugin to ubuntumirclient (to match that of qtubuntu)
    There are some apps which check the QPA name is ubuntumirclient, and

  * Simplify focus logic, fix tablet lifecycle
  * Workaround GL/GLES conflict between Qt and Mir. Split into 3
    packages: GL qpa, GLES qpa & QML plugin Mir is GLES only. Qt on
    desktop is desktop-GL only. To workaround this, (ab)use the fact
    that MESA on the desktop allows you to bind GL apis to a GLES
    context via eglBindAPI. To use this, need to compile with QPA
    separately for GL and GLES targets. Thus need to split the packaging
    into: + qtmir-android - qpa plugin for GLES targets + qtmir-desktop
    - qpa plugin for desktop-GL targets (uses MESA hack) +
    qtdeclarative5-qtmir-plugin - the QML plugin Also stopped unit tests
    from being installed
  * Re-enable Buffer Queueing OpenGL, should improve graphics
    performance
  * Remove refresh-rate override as Mir now returns correct value
  * MirGLContext - temporary gl context from mir does not have
    attributes defined by GLConfig applied, so need to do so manually
  * DisplayWindow listens for Hide/Show events with its event handler,
    not via a static variable
  * QtEventFeeder - add deconstructor to delete the mTouchDevice
  * Application: delete TODO comment in setSession as nonsensical
  * SessionName removed. PID matching was introduced some time ago and
    so session name unnecessary

    implement properly later
  * Fixed threading issue when screen-shotting application about to be
    stopped. By Nick Dedekind
  * Revert rev 179, add comment to clarify
  * Application: replace direct call into MirSurfaceItem with a

  * Merge multiple qml size changes into a single mir surface resize
    Resizing a mir surface is a costly operation and qml items can get
    resized multiple times in a single event loop iteration. Besides, a
    qml item changes its width and height separately
  * Add WindowScreenshotProvider
  * s/upstart-app-launch-2/ubuntu-app-launch-2
  * Add clipboard support had to remove the dependency of mirserver to
    platform-api-client as it caused a clash as both libs are loading
    unityrpc.proto. That's a protobuffer limitation. Added the protobuf
    generated files directly (unityrpc.cpp and unityrpc.h) as I couldn't
    bend qmake to my will.

  * Update Application::fullscreen when the application gets its surface
  * MirSurfaceManager: s/DLOG/qCDebug Use Qt's new categorized logging
    system

    with the copy-pasting unity-mir packaging. Makes no sense in qtmir
    as it never installed a com.canonical.Unity.conf file in the first
    place. That's unity-mir's problems.
