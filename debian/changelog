  [ Gerry Boland ]
  * Update for Mir 0.4.0 compatibility
  * Remove unneeded properties from SurfaceManager and restore support
    for surface with no app parent
  * Add patches to ubuntuclient plugin to enable sharing of GL context -
    needed for oxide
  * Rename client plugin to ubuntumirclient (to match that of qtubuntu)
    There are some apps which check the QPA name is ubuntumirclient, and
    fail with ubuntuclient. Worst offender is Oxide, which is hard to
    rebuild, so this change is easier fix.
  * Revert 125, incorrect branch merged
  * Rename client plugin to ubuntumirclient (to match that of qtubuntu)
    There are some apps which check the QPA name is ubuntumirclient, and
    fail with ubuntuclient. Worst offender is Oxide, which is hard to
    rebuild, so this change is easier fix.
  * Remove surface observer on MirSurfaceItem destruction
  * New apps placed at start of model and are focused immediately.
    AppMan model has proper surface and fullscreen roles now. Whitespace
    fixes
  * Enable UbuntuPlatformServices for a mirserver
  * Fix FTBFS - header file moved
  * Remove ubuntumirclient plugin as it moved to qtubuntu
  * Empty commit to force rebuild for Qt5.3
  * debian: update package name, fixes dependency wait in PPA
  * Fix Qt5.3 compile - QQmlProfiler changed to QQuickProfiler
  * Update README, rename root pro file to match project name
  * debian: replace old libplatform-api-dev with newer libubuntu-
    application-api-dev
  * Fix lifecycle by pulling latest unity-mir code. Rename QML module
    back to Unity.Application. Import unity-mir tests. Use category
    logging
  * Restore code to override side-stage apps to be on main stage on
    single-stage devices
  * Remove unused *toBeFocused state savers
  * debian: update mir & papi version dependencies
  * Fix out-of-tree builds
  * Using const QString ref to save possible QString copy
  * Small header file cleaning
  * Fix test fails - do not run moc again on headers used by tests
  * Downgrade error warning of unmanaged session startup
  * Simplify focus logic, fix tablet lifecycle
  * Workaround GL/GLES conflict between Qt and Mir. Split into 3
    packages: GL qpa, GLES qpa & QML plugin Mir is GLES only. Qt on
    desktop is desktop-GL only. To workaround this, (ab)use the fact
    that MESA on the desktop allows you to bind GL apis to a GLES
    context via eglBindAPI. To use this, need to compile with QPA
    separately for GL and GLES targets. Thus need to split the packaging
    into: + qtmir-android - qpa plugin for GLES targets + qtmir-desktop
    - qpa plugin for desktop-GL targets (uses MESA hack) +
    qtdeclarative5-qtmir-plugin - the QML plugin Also stopped unit tests
    from being installed
  * Re-enable Buffer Queueing OpenGL, should improve graphics
    performance
  * Remove refresh-rate override as Mir now returns correct value
  * MirGLContext - temporary gl context from mir does not have
    attributes defined by GLConfig applied, so need to do so manually
  * DisplayWindow listens for Hide/Show events with its event handler,
    not via a static variable
  * QtEventFeeder - add deconstructor to delete the mTouchDevice
  * Application: delete TODO comment in setSession as nonsensical
  * SessionName removed. PID matching was introduced some time ago and
    so session name unnecessary
  * Application: remove hack to guess app supported orientations,
    implement properly later
  * Fixed threading issue when screen-shotting application about to be
    stopped. By Nick Dedekind
  * Revert rev 179, add comment to clarify
  * Application: replace direct call into MirSurfaceItem with a
    signal/slot. Removes FIXME
  * MirSurfaceItem: setting unfocused on creation breaks camera & videos
    app, so disabling and added fixme
  * Add FIXME about the custom roles
  * Remove redundant comment
  * Remove ApplicationManager::topmostApplication
  * AppMan: if foreground app closes, set all unfocused to let shell
    decide what next to focus
  * Useless static_cast removed
  * DebugHelpers: do not use default state for last option in the enum
    today, the enum may grow in future
  * MirBufferSGTexture: remove the Qt5.3 ifdefs, were probably broken
    for older Qt versions
  * MirSurfaceItem - standardize on qCDebug(QTMIR_SURFACES)
  * MirSurfaceManager: generate roleNames only on read
  * MirSurfaceManager: remove commented line
  * TaskController: add a few more consts
  * Removed WindowScreenshotProvider as not needed for now
  * AppMan: be slightly more verbose with desktop file locating for
    desktop_file_hint. Also use faster exists() static function
  * AppMan: data - remove nonsensical default role
  * ProcessController: expand documentation
  * Clarify licences
  * Give AppMan & SurfMan objectNames
  * MirSurfaceItem: do not print keystrokes to log
  * Fix crash bug - disable input events going to MirSurfaceItem whose
    backing mir surface was destroyed
  * SurfaceManager: do not add each surface to the model twice silly
  * debian: only use gcc4.9 compiler to prevent ABI breaks due to some
    C++11 features still being experimental in gcc
  * AppMan: emit unfocus dbus event on suspend, and focus on resume
  * Revert 214 - breaks install of qtmir and qtubuntu
  * Input Event timestamp - do not overwrite timestamp of events sent to
    client

  [ Nick Dedekind ]
  * Compatibility with mir-0.5

  [ Robert Bruce Park ]
  * CI Train packaging cleanup. Minor packaging cleanup for CI Train
    standards.
  * Slightly more readable debian/rules.

  [ Michael Zanetti ]
  * append newly focused apps instead of prepending them. Allows the ui
    to do the regular app focused animation for newly started apps too
  * Fix multi touch points on mirsurfaceitems. Patch kindly provided by
    anpok.
  * also mir specific key codes through the QKeyEvent

  [ Michael Terry ]
  * Use virtual package names in Conflicts/Replaces fields and clean
    build dirs when doing dh_clean.

  [ Daniel d'Andrada ]
  * ubuntuclient: Properly handle mir's resize event Take it as a
    promise for a future buffer size instead of immediately obeying it.
  * Some MirSurfaceItem fixes Don't assume that it always have an
    Application. Slightly improve its ownership mess.
  * Work around crash in MirSurfaceManager::onSurfaceAttributeChanged
  * Improve debug output of surfaces handled by MirSurfaceManager
  * Make mirserver QPA implement QPlatformIntegration::inputContext() So
    that shell can get a virtual keyboard
  * Wait for screen orientation to stabilize before committing to it
  * Reduce orientation stabilization time and cancel pending change when
    facing up/down
  * Merge multiple qml size changes into a single mir surface resize
    Resizing a mir surface is a costly operation and qml items can get
    resized multiple times in a single event loop iteration. Besides, a
    qml item changes its width and height separately
  * Add WindowScreenshotProvider
  * s/upstart-app-launch-2/ubuntu-app-launch-2
  * Add clipboard support had to remove the dependency of mirserver to
    platform-api-client as it caused a clash as both libs are loading
    unityrpc.proto. That's a protobuffer limitation. Added the protobuf
    generated files directly (unityrpc.cpp and unityrpc.h) as I couldn't
    bend qmake to my will.
  * UbuntuPlatformServices is no longer shared by both QPAs
  * Update Application::fullscreen when the application gets its surface
  * MirSurfaceManager: s/DLOG/qCDebug Use Qt's new categorized logging
    system
  * MirSurfaceManager: improve debug output
  * Hold back this commit for now as qtmir trunk still uses an old mir
    version
  * adapt to latest mir/devel + input_sender branch
  * MirSurfaceManager: improve debug output
  * Revert to the old ways regarding rotation Where unity8 doesn't move
    and apps rotate by themselves. Retake that rotation approach at a
    later time
  * Forward item focus to the underlying mir surface
  * Dispatch keys to mir surface
  * Add a comment with the rationale behind the frame dropper
  * Fix copyright headers
  * Fix and update debian/copyright
  * Removing debian/qtdeclarative5-qtmir-plugin.maintscript This came
    with the copy-pasting unity-mir packaging. Makes no sense in qtmir
    as it never installed a com.canonical.Unity.conf file in the first
    place. That's unity-mir's problems.
  * Add a TODO notice
  * Fix copy-and-paste error in log message
  * Improve Application::setState debug output

  [ Kevin Gunn ]
  * merge lp:~nick-dedekind/qtmir/prompt_sessions
