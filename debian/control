Description: Qt plugins for Ubuntu application API
 QtUbuntu is a set of Qt5 components for the Ubuntu Application
 API. It contains a QPA (Qt Platform Abstraction) plugin based on the
 Ubuntu Application API and a legacy QPA plugin based on the
 compatibility layers. It also provides Qt bindings for Ubuntu
 Application API features that are not exposed through the QPA
 plugins.
