This repo contains a QPA plugin to make Qt a Mir server.

Handy way to grab dependencies is with:
$ sudo mk-build-deps -ir debian/control

To use, compile and install (building in a "build" subdir as an example):
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ../
$ make
$ sudo make install

To enable debug output, replace the single "cmake" command with
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
(is good to "make clean" beforehand)

To avoid building the tests (to speed up the build):
$ cmake -DNO_TESTS=true

To test, enter the demos directory, run:

$ export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=mirserver
$ export DESKTOP_SESSION=unity8-mir

then run the Qt application of your choice (qmlscene best). As example, try

$ qmlscene qml-demo-shell/qml-demo-shell.qml

To run an application, first ensure a correct MIR_SOCKET environment variable is set and the socket 
has correct permissions to be connected to:
$ export MIR_SOCKET=/tmp/mir_socket
and can then run:

$ mir_demo_client_egltriangle --desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/applications/gallery-app.desktop
or
$ export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=ubuntumirclient
$ qmlscene qml-demo-client/qml-demo-client.qml --desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.calendar/0.4.172/calendar-app.desktop

where the desktop file hint specifies an existing file.
